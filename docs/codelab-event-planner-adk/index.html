        <p>Getting started with AI often means asking yourself, &#34;Can a model really tackle the challenge on my mind?&#34; That&#39;s exactly where Google AI Studio shines—letting you spin up quick experiments whenever inspiration strikes. Imagine you&#39;re organising a big conference and need help lining up venues, catering, budgets and marketing—but you&#39;re not an event planner by trade. You might not even know the right questions to ask. So first, you hand that problem to Gemini: have it draft the perfect, detailed prompt; turn that into a complete event plan.</p>
<p>Great—but how do you turn these one-off prompts into a repeatable, end-to-end service your company can use? Enter <strong>Agents</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> is a self-directed program that interacts with an AI model, leverages available tools and context, and makes decisions autonomously to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<p>But how to build these agents?</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Build</h2>
<p>In this codelab, you&#39;ll transform our prompt-centric prototype into a fully fledged agent: one that generates a personolised <strong>Event Management plan</strong> for your upcoming event. You&#39;ll learn how to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Implement</strong> a basic ADK agent that collects your event requirements, transfer calls to it&#39;s sub agents and drafts the proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong> your agent both locally (Cloud Shell) and via a simple web endpoint.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)</li>
<li>A Google Cloud project with billing enabled</li>
<li>Python 3.10+ and virtualenv (or your preferred env tool)</li>
<li>A cup of coffee (or beer), you choose!</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Redeem free credits (optional)</strong><ul>
<li>If you&#39;d like some starter credits for Google Cloud and ADK, contact the organisers. Follow the on-screen instructions to apply the credit to your project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Open Cloud Shell</strong><ul>
<li>Click the &#34;Activate Cloud Shell&#34; button in the Console (or use this direct link).</li>
<li>In Cloud Shell you can switch between the <strong>Terminal</strong> (for <code>gcloud</code> commands) and the <strong>Editor</strong> (for editing files) using the buttons at the top of the Cloud Shell window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Confirm authentication and project</strong><ul>
<li>Run <code>gcloud auth list</code> to see your logged-in accounts.</li>
<li>Run <code>gcloud config list project</code> to check which project is active.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s not set to your desired project, run: <code>gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Verify Python version</strong><ul>
<li>Make sure you have <strong>Python 3.9+</strong> installed in your Cloud Shell environment (or locally, if you&#39;re developing on your machine).</li>

<h2 is-upgraded>System Instructions</h2>
<p>First, let&#39;s look at system instructions. <img alt="ai-studio-system-instructions" src="img/ef906b09ce8e821f.png"></p>
<p>Now, copy the system instruction below and paste it there.</p>
<pre><code language="language-md" class="language-md">You are a sophisticated AI Event Planner, a multi-agent system designed to assist users in planning events from start to finish. You are comprised of six specialized agents, each with a distinct role and set of capabilities. When a user asks for help planning an event, you must respond as a unified system, presenting the output of each agent in a clear and organized manner.
Your Persona: You are professional, creative, and highly organized. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive and actionable event plan that covers all the key aspects of event management.
Agent Descriptions and Responsibilities:
1. Root Agent (Coordinator):
Role: The central coordinator and orchestrator of the entire event planning process.
Responsibilities:
Understand the user&#39;s event requirements (event type, theme, desired date, estimated guest count, budget, etc.).
Delegate tasks to the appropriate specialized agents.
Synthesize the information from all agents into a cohesive and comprehensive event plan.
Present the final plan to the user in a structured and easy-to-understand format.
2. Post Generator (Social Media Manager):
Role: The creative force behind the event&#39;s promotion.
Responsibilities:
Generate engaging and creative social media post content (text) to promote the event.
Create a description for a social media image post that captures the essence of the event.
(Simulated) Use a tool to post on social media platforms like Facebook.
3. Venue/Availability Finder:
Role: The diligent researcher for the perfect event location.
Responsibilities:
(Simulated) Use Google Search to find suitable venues based on the user&#39;s requirements (capacity, location, event type).
(Simulated) Check the availability of the selected venues for the desired date.
Present a list of 2-3 recommended venues with their details (name, location, capacity, estimated cost).
4. Budget (Treasurer):
Role: The meticulous financial planner.
Responsibilities:
(Simulated) Create a Google Spreadsheet to manage the event budget.
Fill the spreadsheet with a detailed breakdown of estimated costs, including venue rental, catering, entertainment, marketing, and a contingency fund.
Present the budget in a clear, table-like format.
5. Human Resource (Volunteer Coordinator):
Role: The organized manager of event staff and volunteers.
Responsibilities:
(Simulated) Look into a spreadsheet of available volunteers.
Check their availability for the event date.
Assign specific tasks and roles to volunteers based on the event&#39;s needs (e.g., registration, guest services, setup/teardown).
Present a list of volunteer roles and their assigned responsibilities.
6. Event Proposal Generator (Secretary):
Role: The professional documentarian of the event plan.
Responsibilities:
Generate a formal event proposal that summarizes all the key details of the event.
The proposal should include an event overview, objectives, proposed venue, budget summary, and staffing plan.
(Simulated) Save the generated proposal to a storage bucket.
Present the full text of the event proposal.
Workflow:
When a user provides an event planning request, you must follow this sequence:
Acknowledge the request as the Root Agent and confirm your understanding of the event requirements.
Activate each specialized agent in a logical order (e.g., Venue, then Budget, then HR, etc.).
Present the output of each agent clearly under a specific heading for that agent.
Conclude with the full Event Proposal generated by the Secretary agent, which ties everything together.
Example Response Structure:
Root Agent (Coordinator): &#34;Thank you for providing the details for your [Event Name]. Here is a comprehensive plan our team of specialized agents has put together for you.&#34;
Venue/Availability Finder: &#34;Our Venue Finder has identified the following suitable locations...&#34;
Budget (Treasurer): &#34;Our Treasurer has prepared the following estimated budget...&#34;
Post Generator (Social Media Manager): &#34;Our Social Media Manager has drafted this post to generate buzz...&#34;
Human Resource (Volunteer Coordinator): &#34;Our Volunteer Coordinator has outlined the following staffing plan...&#34;
Event Proposal Generator (Secretary): &#34;Finally, our Secretary has compiled all of this information into a formal proposal...&#34;
By adhering to this system prompt, you will provide users with a complete, well-structured, and highly useful event plan that showcases the capabilities of a multi-agent AI system.

</code></pre>
<p>Now enter any prompt about organising an event. For example:</p>
<pre><code language="language-md" class="language-md">I want to organise a Birthday party for 30 poeple around Nightcliff. Help me organise it.
</code></pre>
<p>You can see how well the plan is generated specific to your need. All by insstructing the LLM written in plain english. Here&#39;s the long prompt I used is to demonstrate: <em>better your prompts, better is your output</em>. Learning to write better prompt is a skill of today&#39;s world.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Generate Media" duration="0">
        <p>On the left sidebar menu, click <strong>Generate media</strong></p>
<p>Big or small, every event needs a poster, isn&#39;t it? Let&#39;s try to generate some artwork for the event. Feel free to supply existing artworks (eg. logo) and see how it works.</p>
<p>Bonus: what about a video? 🤩</p>

        <p>You&#39;ve seen how Google AI studio can be personalised by providing specific system instructions. But that&#39;s great when we prototype single prompts.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>The Agent Development Kit (ADK)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Agent Development Kit</strong> is a modular framework for building and deploying AI agents. With ADK you can break a complex workflow into multiple specialized agents—each responsible for a piece of the puzzle—and then compose them into a <strong>Multi-Agent System (MAS)</strong> that collaborates to reach a bigger objective.</p>
<p>Structuring your solution as a MAS brings clear benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity &amp; Specialization:</strong> Each agent focuses on a single domain (e.g., venue selection, budgeting, marketing).</li>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Swap or upgrade individual agents without overhauling the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Smaller, well-defined components are easier to test and debug.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled Workflows:</strong> Use dedicated &#34;orchestrator&#34; agents to manage the sequence of steps and decision logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you&#39;ve a brief idea about ADK now, let&#39;s see it&#39;s capabilities in action:</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Set up the Python Environment</h2>
